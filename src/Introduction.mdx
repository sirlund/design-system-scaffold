# Design System Scaffold

**Universal design system generator - from Figma to production in minutes**

---

## Welcome

This is a blank design system scaffold powered by AI agents. You can transform any Figma file into a complete, production-ready design system with:

- ✅ **Design Tokens** (primitives + semantics)
- ✅ **React Components** (TypeScript + CSS Modules)
- ✅ **Storybook Documentation** (auto-generated)
- ✅ **Type Safety** (full TypeScript support)

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Connect to Figma

Extract design tokens from your Figma file:

```bash
# Using Figma MCP (recommended)
/tokens-from-figma https://figma.com/file/YOUR_FILE_ID

# Or place JSON exports in imported-from-figma/
# Then run: npm run tokens:transform
```

### Step 2: Generate Components

Build React components from your Figma designs:

```bash
/component-from-figma button
/component-from-figma card
/component-from-figma input
```

### Step 3: Customize & Publish

Review the generated code, customize as needed, and publish your design system:

```bash
npm run build
npm publish
```

---

## What's Next?

Once you run the token extraction, you'll see:

1. **Design Tokens** section with all your colors, spacing, typography, radius
2. **Components** section with generated React components
3. **Full documentation** with usage examples

---

## AI Agents Available

This scaffold includes three AI agents:

### Design Tokens Agent
Extracts and transforms tokens from Figma exports

**Commands**: `/tokens-from-figma`

### Storybook Documentation Agent
Generates beautiful documentation for your tokens and components

**Auto-activated** after token generation

### Component Builder Agent
Builds React components from Figma designs using your tokens

**Commands**: `/component-from-figma [name]`

---

## Configuration

Edit `scaffold.config.js` to customize:

- Token classification rules
- Naming conventions
- Output structure
- Semantic token generation strategy

---

## Ready?

Run `/tokens-from-figma` to get started!

Or place your Figma JSON exports in the `imported-from-figma/` directory and the agents will detect them automatically.
